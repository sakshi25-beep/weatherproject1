# Weather App 🌤️

A dynamic weather application that provides real-time weather updates for any city worldwide. This project demonstrates how to fetch data from a third-party API and update the UI dynamically based on the response.

## ✨ Features

* **Search by City:** Get instant weather details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed for any location.
* **Current Location:** Uses the Browser Geolocation API to fetch weather for your current coordinates.
* **Dynamic Backgrounds/Icons:** Weather icons change according to the current weather conditions (e.g., Clouds, Rain, Clear).
* **Responsive UI:** Designed to look great on mobile and desktop devices.
* **Error Handling:** Displays an alert or message if the city name is invalid.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structured the weather dashboard and search inputs.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling with a focus on glassmorphism/modern UI.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Used `fetch` API, `async/await`, and DOM manipulation.
* **API:** [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
